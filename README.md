## Various algorithms to find the intersection of two arrays in ruby

Read the comments throughout for more information.

### run the tests:

```
  ruby intersection_test.rb
```

Note that the test for duplicates is expcted to fail with some of the algorithms.


### run the "thunderdome" which runs a degenerate case against all of the algorithms until only one survives.

```
  ruby intersection_thunderdome.rb
```
